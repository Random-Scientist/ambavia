Incomplete implementation of [Desmos Graphing Calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator).

Currently it can parse a list of expressions/assignments, do name resolution and type checking, compile everything into bytecode and then interpret the bytecode to spit out the result of each expression. No plotting or UI yet.
