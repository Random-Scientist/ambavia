Incomplete implementation of [Desmos Graphing Calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator).

Currently it has a cool robust two-stage (Desmos-flavored) LaTeX parser and a half-baked bytecode generator that can evaluate expressions you give it in the command line. No plotting or anything, you can't even define variables.
